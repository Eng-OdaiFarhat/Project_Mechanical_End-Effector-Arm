# Project_Mechanical_End-Effector-Arm

In robotics, an end effector is a device or tool that's connected to the end of a robot arm where the hand would be. 

Robot end effector is the humble gripper. It allows you to pick up and manipulate objects, which makes it best suited to tasks like pick-and-place, assembly, and machine tending.
